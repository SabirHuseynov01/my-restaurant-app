# My Restaurant App

## Overview
This repository is a main project that brings together four different Java projects related to restaurant management. Each project represents a different functionality and is organized under separate folders. The project aims to provide a foundation for developers who want to develop restaurant applications.

## Project Structure
- **delivery-service/**: [Short description, e.g., “Customer order system”]
- **notification-service/**: [Short description, e.g., “Notification Service”]
- **order-service/**: [Short description, e.g., “Order Service”]
- **restaurant-service/**: [Short description, e.g., “Restaurant Service”]

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SabirHuseynov01/my-restaurant-app.git




### Customization Tips
- **Project Description:** Write a short and clear description of what each project in each folder does. For example, if `project1` is an order system, specify this.
- **Images:** If you have screenshots (e.g., output while working in IntelliJ), you can add them using `![Description](image-name.png)`. Upload the images to the repo root.
- **Code Example:** If you want to add a useful Java code example, use a code block (` ```java `) in Markdown.
- **Color and Format:** Use headings (`#`, `##`) and lists (`-`) to make it readable.

### Adding with IntelliJ
1. After creating the `README.md` file, commit it in IntelliJ using `VCS > Commit`.
2. Write a message, for example: “Comprehensive README.md added.”
3. Send it to GitHub using `VCS > Push`.

### Result
With this README, your project will be both more comprehensive and user-friendly. When you open it on GitHub, you'll see a nice description page instead of the “Add a README” button. If there's a specific section you'd like to add (e.g., screenshots, technical details), let us know, and we'll add it right away! 😊
