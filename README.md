# My Restaurant App

A monorepo containing four Java microservices for a sample restaurant management system:
- `delivery-service` — customer delivery/order tracking
- `notification-service` — sends notifications (email/SMS/push)
- `order-service` — handles order lifecycle and business logic
- `restaurant-service` — restaurant data and menu management

> Short, practical guide to getting the project running locally and understanding structure.

### Result
With this README, your project will be both more comprehensive and user-friendly. When you open it on GitHub, you'll see a nice description page instead of the “Add a README” button. If there's a specific section you'd like to add (e.g., screenshots, technical details), let us know, and we'll add it right away! 😊
